            <h3> Surprise, it's not just about games.</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                <h3>In order to have this website, I had to create it.</h3> You know, write code, by myself, letter by letter. Sometimes I cheated, to be honest. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> does magic, recommending you lines of code and even predicting what you are about to do. Add some extensions to it, and it almost feels like your machine reads your mind. <i>Almost</i>.

            <br>
            <p>
                <h3>In order to make a good website, you need a good teacher.</h3> But the best teacher can sometimes be failure, and failure means to start doing something. It's okay to do something and fail than not doing something at all. I had to learn this lesson the hard way. It may sound <i>clicheic</i>, but it's real.
            </p>
            <br>    
            <p>
                <h3>What you have to do is start writing code.</h3> Even if you never did it, just try. Try for once being an alien, and you'll see how beautiful, yet frustrating (to be honest, but I don't want to discourage you) these alien languages can be.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <h3>If you are prepared and feel ready, go.</h3> If you have that feeling in your guts that says "Go, do it, let's make this possible", then don't spend any time thinking if you should actually start doing it, or not. Instead, think of Shia LaBeouf telling you to "Just do it!". Nothing is impossible, you just have to do it.
             </p>
             <br>
            <p>
                <h3>You have to read a lot first.</h3> Read about what things do, then apply them to understand how and why they do it. Your best source is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>. I insist, use this, don't use W3Schools. I'm not the only one saying this.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <h3>So, you want a nice website?</h3> If you do, you have to be up-to-date. Nobody likes old, obsolete, deprecated things. Stay up-to-date, even though it's so hard with today's technology, always on the move, always updating. If you want a nice up-to-date website, considering today's date, you want to write it in <b>HTML5</b> and add a little nice touch of personality and make things beautiful with <b>CSS3</b>.

                Here we go, huge list of HTML elements ahead. Brace yourself. Reminder! All elements should be put between "<" and ">" when writing the code.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Main root</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "html" - This HTML element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Document metadata</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Metadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or link to another file that has the information. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    <b>"link"</b> - The HTML External Resource Link element ("link") specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.

                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>"meta"</b> - The HTML "meta" element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like "base", "link", "script", "style" or "title".

                <li>
                    <b>"style"</b> - The HTML "style" element contains style information for a document, or part of a document.
                </li>

                    <b>"title"</b> - The HTML Title element ("title") defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab.

            <br><br>
            <h3>Sectioning root</h3>
            <br>

            <br><br>
            <h3>Content sectioning</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.
            </p>
            <br>

                    <b>"footer"</b> - The HTML "footer" element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

                    <b>"header"</b> - The HTML "header" element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, a search form, an author name, and so on.

            <br>
            <p>
                 Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening "body" and closing "/body" tags. Important for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or structure of that content.

                <br>

                    <b>"wbr"</b> - The HTML "wbr" element represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.
